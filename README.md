# Bestkeystone_Frontend

This is a project for Bestkeystone Frontend.

Its written in VueJS and using the Quasar Framework.
I've started to rewrite the whole frontend to Vue3 with the setup format, and moved to typescript as well.
So there might be some mismatch here and there.

I started this project when i were very new to frontend development, so the code might be a bit messy.
So feel free to make a pull request if you want to improve the code.

## Setup, fetch pack and run
`npm install`
`quasar dev`

That should be it.

## Quasar Framework
For more information about the Quasar Framework, check out their website: https://quasar.dev


## Pull requests
As i want this project to progress, i would love to get some help.
I will probably be accepting most pull requests, as long as they are not breaking the code and looks okay.
Tho feel free to jump on the discord and ask me if you want to make some massive changes to ensure that it will be accepted.

## Backend
The backend i'm still keeping closed sourced for now, but i might open it up in the future.
I am considering making the database model and a template database available for people to use.
So atleast manual submittions for induvidual features can be made, but will probably see how big the demand is first.
